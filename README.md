# wireframing.
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide or blueprint of a digital product (like a website or app). It shows the layout of elements on a screen, such as menus, buttons, images, and content, without focusing on colors, fonts, or final graphics.

## Key Characteristics of a Wireframe:
+ Usually low-fidelity (simple lines, boxes, and placeholders).

+ Focuses on structure, flow, and functionality.

+ Often drawn by hand or created with digital tools (like Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD).

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
1. Clarifies Structure and Layout
It helps designers and stakeholders visualize the placement of elements and the hierarchy of information before getting into detailed design.

2. Saves Time and Resources
Making changes in a wireframe is much faster and cheaper than modifying a fully designed interface or developed product.

3. Improves User Experience (UX)
It allows teams to think through the user journey early on, identifying pain points or navigation issues before development starts.

4. Enhances Collaboration and Communication
Wireframes serve as a visual communication tool among designers, developers, and clients, ensuring everyone shares a common understanding of the layout and functionality.

5. Guides Development
Developers use wireframes as a reference for layout and functionality, which makes the build process more efficient and aligned with the original vision.
